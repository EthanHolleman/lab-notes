# pFC9 digest with EcoRI SacI

Back from vacation and the inserts are on their way to Davis. Today I am
preparing more pFC9 large fragment for cloning via digestion with SacI
and EcoRI and agarose gel extraction.

## Protocol

Digest 1 ul pFC9 for 1.5 hours with SacI, then digest with EcoRI for 0.5 hrs.
Incubate at 37C in PCR machine. Extract large fragment using Zymoclean DNA recovery protocol.

### Reagents

Split into 5 seperate reactions for incubation. Total DNA per reaction
is then 1 ug.

| Reagent         | Volume (ul) |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| pFC89           | 16.4        |
| SacI-HF         | 5           |
| EcoRI-HF        | 5           |
| Cutsmart buffer | 25          |
| H20             | 198.6       |

### Agarose gel pours

Poured agarose gel very thin, 25 ul per gel. Hopefully will reduce amount of gel during extraction but probably need to split samples
as I don't think the 50ul volume will fit into one lane.

Tested gels after set with loading dye to measure capacity and was
only about 15 ul per lane. Re-poured gels with similar depth but larger
wells (6 per gel).
