## Chloroquine gel round two results

Picked up chloroquine gel I started yesterday. Prepared gel for imaging
as described on [9/28/21](44_9-28-21.md#Chloroquine-gel-post-staining-and-imaging).

### Lane layout

pFC9 substrate.

| Lane | Treatment       |
| ---- | --------------- |
| 1    | Control         |
| 2    | + Topo          |
| 3    | + Topo + Gyrase |

### Gel image

Need to get off flashdrive.

Looks like the DNA has run off the gel. Need to adjust running time. Maybe
previously we had some kind of mega gel?

## PCR contamination test round three

Set up four samples with same master mix I used in [9/28/21](44_9-28-21.md#Master-mix) PCR tests but with a Taq I purchased today from the scientific
store (never been touched before) which also came with two 10X buffer solutions.

| Item               | Product code | Lot      | Count |
| ------------------ | ------------ | -------- | ----- |
| DNA Taq Polymerase | M0273S       | 1009991  | 1     |
| 10x DNA Pol buffer | B90145       | 10114545 | 2     |

Lanes with Taq show some contamination plus a possible additional band? This
means that contamination is still spreading or one or more of the reagents I used
in the master mix is not as clean as I thought it might be. Need to use
reagents that I have never even seen before in my life.

## New PCR mix, working in cell culture hood

Working in the cell culture hood with a new set of pipettes a made a new
master mix and dNTP mix which are described in the tables below.

### dNTP mix

| Reagent     | Volume      |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| dNTPs       | 40 ul (\*4) |
| npH20 fresh | 460 ul      |

### Master mix (A)

| Reagent                     | Volume (ul) |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| dNTP                        | 5           |
| 10x Buffer (Lot: 10114545 ) | 30          |
| H20 fresh                   | 103         |

From this master mix I fractioned 70 ul and added 2.5 ul of each VR insert
primer. From this second fraction (B) I fractioned 35 ul and added 1 ul of Taq
Pol (Lot: 1009991).

### PCR reactions and gel

Using the reagents described above I set up the following PCR reactions and
ran each for 34 cycles using standard PCR reaction and left overnight

| Sample | Treatment        |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| 1      | A                |
| 2      | B                |
| 3      | C                |
| 4      | A + VR23 Vector  |
| 5      | B + VR 23 Vector |
| 6      | C + VR 23 Vector |
| 7      | A + Taq          |
