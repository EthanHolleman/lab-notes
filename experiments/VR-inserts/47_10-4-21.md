# Gibson assembly reagent prep and VR fragment validation

## Gibson assembly reagent prep

Prepped new Gibson assembly reagents; 5x isothermal buffer
and 1.33x master mix according to the [Gibson assembly recipe spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dd30Xx1bssh19DX4bBkxRS1dTOeNpFEqQdiE2VyVzRM/edit?usp=sharing).

## BglII digestion followed by PCR product validation

Testing that BglII digestion followed by PCR amplification from 10/1/21 are the
correct lengths by using VR-31 PCR product as a loading control. VR-31 was
was supplied directly as a fragment and so PCR product should be exactly the
correct length. All samples were composed of the reagents below.

- 3 ul PCR product
- 8 ul npH20
- 3 ul purple loading dye

Loaded all samples onto 0.8% 1x TAE agarose gel with 2 ul EtBr added to both the
gel and 20 ul EtBr in the 1x TAE running buffer. Lane layout is shown in the table below.

| Lane | Sample      | Lane | Sample |
|------|-------------|------|--------|
| 1    | 1 kb ladder | 6    | VR-16  |
| 2    | VR-31       | 7    | VR-17  |
| 3    | VR-8        | 8    | VR-20  |
| 4    | VR-12       | 9    | VR-21  |
| 5    | VR-15       |      |        |

## BglII digestion followed by PCR AGE

Started gel with all BglII -> PCR samples for agarose gel extraction. Made the gel
with 100 ml 0.8 agarose with 4 ul EtBr using 1x TAE for both the agarose gel and
the running buffer. Added 40 ul EtBr to the running buffer. Ran gel at 120 V for
45 mins on undergrad bench. After running gel extracted VR insert
bands using tin foil method on the trans-illuminator. Extracted DNA from bands using freeze and squeeze protocol.

### Agarose extraction yields

| Sample | ng/ul | Sample | ng/ul |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| 8      | 281.9 | 21     | 420   |
| 12     | 268   | 23     | 433   |
| 15     | 474   | 25     | 297   |
| 16     | 314   | 27     | 205   |
| 17     | 360   | 31     | 311   |
| 20     | 342   |        |       |

### Agarose gel extraction product gel

Given the high yield of the extractions I went ahead and
ran the extracted products out on another gel. I loaded ~500 ng
of each sample along with 3 ul purple loading dye and 8 ul H20 onto 0.8% 1x TAE agarose gel. Run the gel for 45 mins at 120V.
Lane layout is below.

| Lane | Sample | Lane | Sample |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| 1    | 30     | 7    | 20     |
| 2    | 8      | 8    | 21     |
| 3    | 12     | 9    | 23     |
| 4    | 15     | 10   | 25     |
| 5    | 16     | 11   | 27     |
| 6    | 17     | 12   | 31     |
