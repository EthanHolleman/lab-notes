# Gibson assembly and big IVT attempt

## Gibson assembly

Prepared three Gibson assembly reactions detailed on table [10/5/21 of the Gibson assembly spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dd30Xx1bssh19DX4bBkxRS1dTOeNpFEqQdiE2VyVzRM/edit#gid=903135954&range=A1) using
samples pFC9-9-10-21 sample 1 as the backbone vector. Diluted all Vr inserts
to 50 ng/ul before adding to reaction mix. At 9:30 AM I placed Gibson assembly
reactions on ice to help Tadas and decided to only move forward with samples VR 8, 12 and 15 plus a negative control to check the reagents were still good before expending a large number
of chemically competent cells.

## IVT reactions

Wanted to set up a large IVT gel to potentially show to math collabortors
for my presentation to them tomorrow. However, we were out of NEB RnaseH1 and
so had to use lab stock RnaseH2 whose activity was in question. Other than this
change I followed the lab IVT protocol with samples VR 1, 2, 3, 4A, 5A, 10, 14, 13,
18, 20, 28, 29A and pFC9.

### IVT gel

Ran IVT reactions on 0.8% agarose 1x TBE gel (no EtBr) in 1x TBE for
2 hours at 60V. Lane layout is below. Each sample has three lanes
first is the untranscribed control, second is transcribed RNAseH2
treated and final is the transcribed untreated lane.



| Lane | Sample | Treatment    | Lane | Sample | Treatment    |
|------|--------|--------------|------|--------|--------------|
| 1    | VR-1   | None         | 20   | VR-14  | T7 + RnaseH2 |

| 3    | VR-1   | T7           | 22   | VR-13  | None         |

| 10   | VR-4A  | None         | 29   | VR-20  | T7 + RnaseH2 |
| 11   | VR-4A  | T7 + RnaseH2 | 30   | VR-20  | T7           |
| 12   | VR-4A  | T7           | 31   | VR-28  | None         |
| 13   | VR-5A  | None         | 32   | VR-28  | T7 + RnaseH2 |
| 14   | VR-5A  | T7 + RnaseH2 | 33   | VR-28  | T7           |
| 15   | VR-5A  | T7           | 34   | VR-29A | None         |
| 16   | VR-10  | None         | 35   | VR-29A | T7 + RnaseH2 |
| 17   | VR-10  | T7 + RnaseH2 | 36   | VR-29A | T7           |
| 18   | VR-10  | T7           | 37   | pFC9   | None         |
| 19   | VR-14  | None         | 38   | pFC9   | T7 + RnaseH2 |
|      |        |              | 39   | pFC9   | T7           |

Unfortunately, gel is not clean enough to show to math people but
does show variability between plasmids to some degree. However, it
is difficult to determine how effective RnaseH2 treatment was
as resolving R-loops.
