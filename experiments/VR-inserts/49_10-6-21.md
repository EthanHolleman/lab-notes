# Gibson assembly and E. coli transformations

Picked up plates from Gibson assembly reactions [yesterday](48_10-5-21.md)
and all samples had at least some colonies which was nice to see. Tada's VR-30
transformations does not unfortunately.

Given that transformations of VR 8, 12 and 15 were successful I preformed an
additional Gibson assembly reaction with the remaining samples (VR 16, 17, 20, 21,
23, 25, 27, and 31) using the reagents and volumes described in table [10-5-21 of the Gibson assembly spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dd30Xx1bssh19DX4bBkxRS1dTOeNpFEqQdiE2VyVzRM/edit#gid=903135954&range=A1). After
incubating samples at 50C for 1 hour I placed samples into the deli fridge for 5 hours while I helped Tadas with culturing colonies and did class work. At 1:20 PM
I transformed electro-compentent cells following previously used NEB protocol with 4 ul of Gibson assembly reaction per sample. At 3:10 I retrieved samples from the
37C room after shaking and plated 200 ul of each culture onto LB + Amp plates which
I then places in the 37C hot room to grow overnight.
