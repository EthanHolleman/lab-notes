# Chloroquine gel imaging and Gibson assembly reaction component gathering

## Chloroquine gel wash and imaging

Arrived at the lab around 7:00 am and removed chloroquine gel from
the gel box. Fire alarm went off at 7:15 and had to leave the lab. Chloroquine gel in npH20 wash for two hours. At 9:44 I removed the
gel from the wash and post stained with EtBr at a concentration of 0.04 ul/ul. After post staining for 30 minutes I imaged the gel using the 2nd floor BioRad imager.

pFC9 shows the greatest degree of smearing, and the darkest bands
indicating a higher concentration of DNA compared to the other
samples. This may be due to the fact all samples except pFC9
are from mini-preps and may have some residual RNA. Various
degrees of shifting are observable between the different plasmids. Fred did bring up the point though that we are not
really learning anything new from this gel and that running
a gel with R-loop containing plasmids that also has chloroquine
in it may not really make sense as the effect chloroquine has
on R-loop structures is not really known. At least now I should
be able to consistently do this assay if need be but its
utility for examining in greater detail the results of IVT as
I hoped I would be able to do is in question and unlikely to
be worth further pursuing.

## BglII digestion followed by PCR amplification of vector bound VR inserts

Digested samples VR 8, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 25, 27 and 31 with BglII to
remove fragments from supplied vectors.

### Digestion conditions

Each digestion occurred in 10 ul total reaction volume (same reaction setup as
preformed on [9/23/21](41_9-23-21.md)). 

- 10 ul total reaction volume
    - 0.2 ul BglII
    - 1 ul insert vector (50 ng)
    - 1 ul 10x r3.1 buffer 
    - 7.8 ul npH20 (opened 9/27/21)

I also included the following negative controls.

- C: H<sub>2</sub>0 + BglII buffer 
- CB: C + BglII
- CBPCR: CB + PCR master mix

All controls were PCR amplified along with vector samples. All
samples were incubated in thermocycler at 37C for 1 hour. Digest completed at 9:15 AM. I then placed all samples into deli fridge. At 10 AM I prepped a PCR master mix to amplify the inserts in
hood in the tissue culture room and add 25 ul PCR master mix
to each BglII digestion.

#### Digestion and PCR results

After amplification ran PCR products on gel. Loaded 3ul each sample
with 3 ul purple loading dye and 7 ul H20 onto 0.8% agarose gel made with 1x TAE in a 1x TAE buffer with 2 ul/100ml EtBr in both
buffer and agarose. I then ran the gel at 120V for 45 minutes.

## Glass bead cleaning

Cleaned glass beads for E. coli transformations. Soaked beads in 10% bleach npH<sub>2</sub>O solution for 20 mins starting at 8:48 am. After rinsing I placed beads in oven to dry overnight.
