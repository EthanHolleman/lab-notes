# Insert fragment synthesis continued, BglII digestions and revisiting IVT

## Transformation efficiency of old chemically competent cells

Yesterday I set up a control transformation to measure the efficiently
of old chemically competent cells I found in the -80C. Three colonies
grew equating to an efficiency of 1.9e6 transformants / ug plasmid. On
the low end of what is acceptable but potentially still workable.


## Insert fragment creation continued

### Overnight PCR results

Yesterday I set a PCR to run as I was leaving the lab. OD results
from each sample are in the table below.

| Insert | ng/ul |
|--------|-------|
| 6      | 114.6 |
| 7      | 123.6 |
| 8      | 129   |
| 9      | 87    |
| 12     | 123   |
| 15     | 109   |
| 16     | 151   |
| 21     | 66    |
| 23     | 342   |
| 26     | 340   |
| 27     | 303   |
| 28     | 220.9 |

Now we have about double the DNA. Turns out its important to have
nucleotides in your PCR mix. Although there must have been some free
from the thermo synthesis reactions because even without adding there
was some degree of amplification. Either way there was enough DNA to
move onto BglII digestion.

### Digestion of successful PCR reactions

Next, having enough DNA to move forward I digested vector originating
samples (8, 12, 15, 16, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28) with BglII using the reagents and volumes in the table below.

| Reagent         | Volume (ul) |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| PCR product     | ~25         |
| BglII           | 1           |
| r3.1 10x buffer | 5           |
| H20             | 19          |
