# pFC53tac and pFC8tac digests plus primer design

Today I am continuing to work on determining the true identity and content
of the pFC53 plasmids. I also designed primers to amplify each plasmid for
sequencing.

## pFC53tac and pFC8tac digest

I digested Rachel's pFC53tac and pFC8tac and my own pFC53tac I prepared from
Rachel's pFC53tac stock. Below are the expected results for digests of true
pFC53tac and pFC8tac.

2:  pFC53tacT1T2

    EcoRI
       1. 4320 bp

4:  pFC8tacT1T2
       1. 3916 bp

5:  pFC8tacT1T2
    BamHI + NotI
       1. 3306 bp
       2. 589 bp
       3. 21 bp

6:  pFC8tacT1T2
    EcoRI + XbaI
       1. 2574 bp
       2. 818 bp
       3. 524 bp
```

## Results

Ran 0.08 agarose gel in TAE for 45 mins at 120V (shown below). R are
Rachel's plasmids while EH are my own.

All digests look basically the same and match the expected results for
the simulated digest of pFC8tac. At this point I would say with confidence
that Rachel's pFC53tac tube should be relabeled as pFC8tacT1T2. The double
band produced by the EcoRI digest confirms the presence of the T1T2 terminators.

## pFC primer design

Primer design for sequencing pFC series plasmids. In order to be absolutely
sure about the identity of each plasmid I will sequence each plasmid I am
planning on working with using the primers in the below sections.
This is my first time designing primers for the lab
and so to keep track of them I created a
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hC9VYnkETDaF73ewFpsUHhBizdWiu8ck4LPnwME005o/edit?usp=sharing) were details of all future oligos
should be stored.

All PCR programs calculated using pydna `pcr` module for Tac polymerase.
Notebook for protocol generation can be found [here](notebooks/7-29-21-pcr-rxns.ipynb) or [pdf version here](notebooks/exported_notebooks/7-29-21-pcr-rxns.pdf).

## Insert sequence primers

Since I was ordering primers I also added primers that will amplify all variable regions inserts in case we need to make a larger amount of any
insert.
