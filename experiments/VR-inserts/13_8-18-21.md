# Recieved and organized VR inserts

Most of the VR insert sequences arrived in the mail today so I spent some time
resuspending those and organizing data associated with them.

## Resuspension

Resuspended all inserts in TE buffer provided by Megan (thanks!) so
all inserts have a final concentration of 50 ng/ul of DNA. Then
placed all inserts into a new box labeled `VR fragments` and placed
onto my shelf in the kitchen freezer.

## VR insert data management

### Cataloging

I created [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Acjxxr_wcgo72ovyZml5Bgda3XjoYGzPz-5cVT0Xo8/edit?usp=sharing) 
which catalogues each insert that has arrived,
it's total mass, and lot number.

### Quality control data

Thermo also provided a CD (???) of quality control data for each insert
that arrived. I transferred that data to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1simpSe7-85Vjd4zzpQkHUAsRsigMAkMd?usp=sharing) but have not spent
much time reviewing it.
