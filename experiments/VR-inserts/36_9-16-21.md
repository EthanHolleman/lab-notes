## VR insert IVT

Ran IVT with completed inserts that had enough DNA to spare to use
in an IVT. Reaction descriptions are listed in the table below.

Then ran products on TBE gel without EtBR for 2 hours at 60V. Then
post-stained the gel for 45mins in TBE with EtBr.

## VR vector BglII digestion

Digested 200 ng fragments from vectors with 0.2 ul BglII for 1hr in the hot room at 37C.

There is a subtle shift in band heights that
may be due to under digestion but Fred suggested
this may also be due to sequences differences
resulting in different DNA secondary structures
subtle band height differences.
