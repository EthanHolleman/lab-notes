# Identifying contamination in BglII digestions and amplification

Set up series of PCR reactions in order to identify reagent or reagent(s) that may contain the contaminate identified on [9-21-21](39_9-21-21.md).

## BglII reagent screen

Set up PCR using same master mix I used in [9-21-21](39_9-21-21.md)
digestions with individual digest reagents shown in the table below.

| Sample | Reagent                                        |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | npH20 (old previously used in 9/21/21 digests) |
| 2      | npH20 (new opened today)                       |
| 3      | 10x 3.1 buffer                                 |
| 4      | BglII enzyme                                   |
| 5      | 10 mM Tris-HCL                                 |


After 2 hour PCR reaction ODed each sample results of which are below.

| Sample | ng / ul |
| ------ | ------- |
| 1      | 153     |
| 2      | 157     |
| 3      | 196     |
| 4      | 330     |
| 5      | 175     |

All samples showed amplification and *no* insert was added to each
sample. The sample master mix was used for each sample so it seems
likely that one or more of the reagents that compose the PCR master
mix is contaminated.

## PCR master mix reagent screen

Since PCR is required for determine if contamination is present
I set up reactions where one of the reagents I used to create the
offending master mix was absent. Reactions that do no show amplification when a reagent is swapped out will reveal the
contaminating reagent.

| Sample | Buffer | Taq         | dDTPs | Testing |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- | ----- | ------- |
| 1      | OneTaq | Lab Taq red | Red   | Taq     |
| 2      | GoTaq  | Lab Taq     | Red   | Buffer  |
| 3      | OneTaq | LAb Taq     | Daisy | dNTPs   |

Sample 4 was the PCR master mix itself. Added VR insert primers to each sample and then ran 2 hour
PCR reaction.

| Sample | ng / ul |
| ------ | ------- |
| 1      | 143     |
| 2      | 471     |
| 3      | 0       |
| 4      | 879     |

From this test it looks like the dNTPs have been contaminated with something.
