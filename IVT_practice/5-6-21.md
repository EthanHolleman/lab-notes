# Debugging IVT

Yesterday used pFC11 and pFC8 for IVT experiments,
but should have realized pFC11 is not R-loop forming. However, pFC8 did not show *any* transcription. I want to both retest a R-loop forming plasmid with a T7 promoter and 2 T3 R-loop formers to see if the T3 needs to be reordered. 

The full FC plasmid table with respect to their
promoters and R-loop forming abilities is below.

Currently have pFC8, 11, 14, 15, 17, 32 and 44 in
the IVT box. 

Also re-read the protocol and was using too much DTT (should be 10 mM) and way too much RNaseA. Fred
says dilute 0.1mg/ml to 100x. That was probably eating up any R-loops that might have formed.

## Protocol

pFC8 DNA concentration: 240 ng / ul
pFC14 DNA concentration: 1452 ng / ul

|  Reagent  |     pFC8   |   pFC14    |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------  |
| 5x Buffer |     4      |    4       |
| 100 mM DTT|     2      |     2      |
| 25 mM NTP |    0.4     |     0.4    |
|    H20    |    11.1    |     13.187 |
|    DNA    |    2.5     |   0.413    |

Diluted stock RNaseA 100x and added 0.5 ul per sample. Both
samples use the T3 Pol.
