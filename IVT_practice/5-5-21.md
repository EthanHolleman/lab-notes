# IVT practice with pFC8 and pFC11

### IVT pFC8

DNA concentration: 740 ng / ul

| Name       | Volume (ul) | 
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 5x Buffer  |       4     |
| 100 mM DTT |       4     |
|2.5 mM NTP  |       1     |
|   DNA      |     0.81    |
|   H20      |     10.19   |

Used **T7 Pol** but was informed by Fred that pFC8 does not actually
have a T7 promoter (oops) so this was never going to work out and is
hopefully why the other gels failed as well.

### Gel image

No shift since not using the correct POL.

0.8 % TBE agarose ran 90v for 1 hr with 1ul 1kb Thermofisher O'Gene ruler.

### Tube labeling

Order in gel (right to left) is the same.
